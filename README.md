🐞 Zippy Royalty Bugger 👑
For the bug-busting monarch in you.

Built by Daltone with pure fullstack wizardry using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

💥 What It Do
Zippy Royalty Bugger isn’t just a bug tracker — it’s the throne room for squashing tech drama.

📝 Report a Bug: Got a bug? Name it. Shame it. Frame it.

📋 View All Bugs: See the royal court of issues—ranked, listed, exposed.

🔄 Update Status: Flip bugs from “Open” to “In-Progress” to “Resolved”. Like a status update for your stress.

🗑️ Delete Bug: Gone. Banished. Unseen.

🛡️ Error Boundaries: React won’t explode, even when your code does.

✅ Testing Everything: Backend? Frontend? Fully covered. Like a knight in armor.
